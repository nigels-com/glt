/*! \defgroup Node GLT Node
    \brief    Simple Scene-Graph Functionality
    
    The node module of GLT is concerned with heirachical
    (scenegraph style) representation and functionality
    for OpenGL programs.  While not intended as an
    industrial-strength scenegraph, most higher-level
    OpenGL rendering functionality is encapsulated as
    GltShape derived scenegraph nodes.
